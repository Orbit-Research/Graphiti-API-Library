# Graphiti API Library

Library containing API calls of the Graphiti by Orbit Research. Copyright Â© 2025 Advanced Research and Development. All Rights Reserved.

## Features

- Easy-to-use C API for controlling Graphiti
- Supports tactile rendering, pin control, and device status queries
- Compatible with Windows and Linux

## Requirements

- C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
- CMake (optional, for building the examples)

## Folder Structure

- .vscode 
    - Contains visual studio code settings

- binding 
    - includes folders for bindings of specific languages for the library and test files for running the library 

    - The C folder includes main.c as the library should be compiled so that it has the C wrapper that allows use of C for the 
        library

    - A java binding has currently not been written (7/25/2025)

    - Python currently has a wrapper called graphiti.py but it is not working (7/25/2025)

- build
    - contains the build of the library with any run file it was run most recently which is typically the tests from the 
        TestFolder

- CMakeListsFiles
    - Contains text files of the contents of CMakeLists.txt that are used for different things

    - CMakeLists_For_using_Library.txt
        - Used for compiling the library with your code with the lib versions of the library for a C++ program
